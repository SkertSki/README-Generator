# README File Generator

  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## DESCRIPTION

  I was having trouble creating README files, and got sick of googling how to create a README everytime I needed to create a README file.

  To make an easier and more streamline way of creating a README.

  With my development skills being that of a beginner, it was touch to get the project to work.

  I learned about async functions and gained a better understanding of how to import/export from one file to another.

  I have added many more optional questions to this project, particularly in the description area that might make for a more detailed README file. 

  I had to overcome a general lack of knowledge, or lack of understanding of how to implement various pieces of code. 

  I would make this app function from a web browser and make it automatically download the file to the user.
